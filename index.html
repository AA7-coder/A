  <h2 >Background</h2>

  <p class="background-life">Lionel Messi was born in Rosario, Argentina, in 1987 and started playing football as a child. At age 13, he moved to Barcelona, Spain, after FC Barcelona offered to pay for his treatment for a growth hormone deficiency. He quickly rose through Barcelona's youth ranks, making his official debut and scoring his first goal in 2004. </p>
